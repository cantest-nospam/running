# Contributing Errata

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to this YouRata repository!

The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how errata for a YouTube video is submitted.

## Expert Submissions

By submitting a pull request, subject matter experts can provide factual corrections in the form of errata. This helps to notify interested parties of any erroneous statements, even if nobody is certain of the truth.  

Errata submissions should contain at least:
- The time in the video the mistake was made
- A summary of the erroneous statement
- The corrected statement as it pertains to the YouTube video
- Independent knowledge sources

Sources may be reviewed by the repository collaborators so it is beneficial to include at least one of the following:
- A book or publication title (include snippets of the relevant pages if possible in the **Leave a comment** field)
- Pictures (include the picture if possible in the **Leave a comment** field)
- Archival footage (include the link to the video if possible)
- Previous YouTube videos from the content creator (include the link to the video)
- First hand experiences (include your position and timeframe)
- Common knowledge

> **Note**
> 
> When using common knowledge as a source, it is important to keep in mind that what is common knowledge to you may not be well-known by others including the content creator. Rhetorical questions can help others understand your logic.

### Example

`At {time} it is stated {statement}, however {corrected statement}, see {references or common knowledge}`

If there are duplicate erroneous statements in the video, only submit errata for the _first_ occurrence. There is a chance that another expert may have already submitted a pull request for the errata you are addressing; you can check open [pull requests](/../../pulls) before submitting a new one.

## Content Creator Additions

Content creators can post corrections directly to the errata files. This helps to notify interested parties of any erroneous statements, even if the content creator is not certain of the truth.  

Errata additions should contain at least:
- The time in the video the mistake was made
- The corrected statement as it pertains to the YouTube video

### Example

`At {time} we meant to say {corrected statement}`
