# Purpose

Millions of people rely on the information found in YouTube videos. However, YouTube does not provide any means for the content creators to edit these videos after publishing. Furthermore, there is no formal, evidence-based feedback process for viewers to contact the creators about errors in the content. This perpetuates the spread of false information and limits sources to only what the creator had access to at the time of publishing.

# Learn how to use YouRata

Anyone who finds an error on this YouTube channel can contribute errata. Before submitting errata you must indicate the specific time in the video when the statement was made, what was said, the correct statement, and provide any evidence in the form of references. See [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
